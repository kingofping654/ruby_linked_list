# ruby_linked_list
A linked list made in Ruby. Even though Ruby doesn't really need linked list.

This project was not very fun at all. I watched and read a ton on linked lists and got it conceptually. but when I got to coding it I just had no idea where to start. Eventually I got some help and made some progress but it felt like I just lacked an understanding to make it work. I 97.5% understand how it works now but still some of it confuses me. It does work though and thats all I needed from this.
